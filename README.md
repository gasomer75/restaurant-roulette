## Overview

A web application that is designed to eliminate frustration in deciding where to go out to eat. The user has a few simple inputs and after clicking a button is presented with a random dining choice that falls within the selected criteria. The random selection will display an image from the restaurant as well as the address, customer rating, number of customer reviews received, and an interactive map showing the location. The roulette button can be clicked multiple times without re-selecting criteria, each time presenting a new choice. Results will be stored so that the user can return to a previous result for that restaurant information.
